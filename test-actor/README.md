# Test Apify Orchestrator

An Actor that spawns itself multiple times using the Apify Orchestrator from the same repository.

This actor was designed to run on the platform.
To use it, push it to the platform with the command:

```sh
npm run push
```

If you want to develop this test Actor after some changes to the Apify Orchestrator, run:

```sh
npm run cp
```

to copy the updated code. The copy will not be excluded from the repository.
